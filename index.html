    Liverpool FC, in full Liverpool Football Club,
    English professional football (soccer) club based in Liverpool.
    It is the most successful English team in European football
    tournament history, having won six European Cup/Champions League
    trophies. The club has also won the English top-division league
    title 19 times.

    <p>Everton FC was the first football team to play in the Anfield stadium that is famous today as Liverpool FC’s historic home.
    A dispute between Everton and the site’s owner, John Houlding, resulted in Everton moving to Goodison
    Park and Houlding forming a new team that was eventually named Liverpool FC.
    The new club played its first game in 1892 and won its first league title in the 1900–01 season.
    In 1906 Anfield’s newly constructed terrace grandstand was christened Spion Kop for its resemblance
    to a hill where a famous South African War battle had been fought
    , which led to the well-known “Kopites” nickname for Liverpool’s fans.</p>
